If you use this package please share your thoughts on how we can improve this hook with version 4.
Please engage at the corresponding [Github issue](https://github.com/JohannesKlauss/react-hotkeys-hook/issues/574).

## Installation

```shell
npm install react-hotkeys-hook
```

or

```shell
yarn add react-hotkeys-hook
```

Make sure that you have at least version 16.8 of `react` and `react-dom` installed, or otherwise hooks won't work for you.

## Usage
```js
export const ExampleComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  useHotkeys('ctrl+k', () => setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1));
    
  return (
    <p>
      Pressed {count} times.
    </p>
  );
};
```

The hook takes care of all the binding and unbinding for you.
As soon as the component mounts into the DOM, the key stroke will be
listened to. When the component unmounts it will stop listening.

### Call Signature

```typescript
useHotkeys(keys: string, callback: (event: KeyboardEvent, handler: HotkeysEvent) => void, options: Options = {}, dependencies: DependencyList = [])
```

### Parameters
- `keys: string`: Here you can set the key strokes you want the hook to listen to. You can use single or multiple keys,
modifier combination, etc. See [this](https://github.com/jaywcjlove/hotkeys/#defining-shortcuts)
section on the hotkeys documentation for more info.
- `callback: (event: KeyboardEvent, handler: HotkeysEvent) => void`: Gets executed when the defined keystroke
gets hit by the user. **Important:** Since version 1.5.0 this callback gets memoised inside the hook. So you don't have
to do this anymore by yourself.
- `options: Options = {}`
  - `filter: (event: KeyboardEvent): boolean` is used to filter if a callback gets triggered depending on the keyboard event.
    **Breaking Change in `3.0.0`!** Prior to version `3.0.0` the filter settings was one global setting that applied to every
    hook. Since `3.0.0` this behavior changed. The `filter` option is now locally scoped to each call of `useHotkeys`.
  - `filterPreventDefault: boolean` is used to prevent/allow the default browser behavior for the keystroke when the filter return false (default value: `true`)
  - `enableOnTags: string[]` is used to enable listening to hotkeys in form fields. Available values are `INPUT`, `TEXTAREA` and `SELECT`.
  - `splitKey: string` is used to change the splitting character inside the keys argument. Default is `+`, but if you want
    to listen to the `+` character, you can set `splitKey` to i.e. `-` and listen for `ctrl-+`
  - `keyup: boolean` Determine if you want to listen on the keyup event
  - `keydown: boolean` Determine if want to listen on the keydown event
  - `enabled: boolean` is used to prevent installation of the hotkey when set to false (default value: `true`)
- `dependencies: DependencyList = []`: The dependency array that gets appended to the memoisation of the callback. Here you define the inner
dependencies of your callback. If for example your callback actions depend on a referentially unstable value or a value
that will change over time, you should add this value to your dependencies array. Since most of the time your callback won't
depend on any unstable callbacks or changing values over time you can leave this value alone since it will be set to an
empty array by default. See the [Memoisation](#memoisation) section to
learn more and see an example where you have to set this array.

### `isHotkeyPressed` function

This function allows us to check if the user is currently pressing down a key.

```ts
import { isHotkeyPressed } from 'react-hotkeys-hook';

isHotkeyPressed('return'); // Returns true if Return key is pressed down.
```
