# useHotkeys

The `useHotkeys` hook follows the hotkeys call signature.

When the component gets mounted into the DOM, it will listen for the keystroke. When the component will unmount, it
stops listening for the keystroke.

```ts
useHotkeys(keys: string, callback: (event: KeyboardEvent, handler: HotkeysEvent) => void, options: Options = {}, deps: any[] = [])
```

## Parameters
* `keys: string`: Here you can set the key strokes you want the hook to listen to. You can use single or multiple keys,
modifier combination, etc. See [this](https://github.com/jaywcjlove/hotkeys/#defining-shortcuts)
section on the hotkeys documentation for more info.
* `callback: (event: KeyboardEvent, handler: HotkeysEvent) => void`: Gets executed when the defined keystroke
gets hit by the user.
* `options: Options = {}` Pass options directly to the hotkeys package. See [Options](#options) section for more details.
* `deps: any[] = []`: The dependency array that gets appended to the memoisation of the callback. Here you define the inner
dependencies of your callback. If for example your callback actions depend on a referentially unstable value or a value
that will change over time, you should add this value to your deps array. Since most of the time your callback won't
depend on any unstable callbacks or changing values over time you can leave this value alone since it will be set to an
empty array by default. See the [Memoisation](#memoisation) section to
learn more and see an example where you have to set this array.

**Note**: The `options` and `deps` parameter are switched in versions < 2.

## Example

This will listen to the `ctrl+k` keystroke. If you press it, the counter increments by one. If `ctrl+l` gets pressed,
the counter will decrement by one.

```js
import { useHotkeys } from 'react-hotkeys-hook';
```

<Playground>
  {() => {
    const [amount, setAmount] = useState(0);
    useHotkeys('ctrl+a', () => setAmount(prevAmount => prevAmount + 100));
    useHotkeys('ctrl+d', () => setAmount(prevAmount => prevAmount - 100));
    return (
      <div>
        {amount >= 0 ? 'Add' : 'Remove'} {Math.abs(amount)} dollars {amount >= 0 ? 'from' : 'to'} my bank account.
      </div>
    );
  }}
</Playground>

## Options

The options parameter is used to pass options directly to the hotkeys package. Check out the [hotkeys docs](https://github.com/jaywcjlove/hotkeys/#option)
for an overview.

### Parameters
* `filter: (event: KeyboardEvent): boolean` is used to filter if a callback gets triggered depending on the keyboard event.
**Breaking Change in `3.0.0`!** Prior to version `3.0.0` the filter settings was one global setting that applied to every
hook. Since `3.0.0` this behavior changed. The `filter` option is now locally scoped to each call of `useHotkeys`.
* `filterPreventDefault: boolean` is used to prevent/allow the default browser behavior for the keystroke when the filter
return false (default value: `true`)
* `enableOnTags: string[]` is used to enable listening to hotkeys in form fields. Available values are `INPUT`, `TEXTAREA`
and `SELECT`.
* `enabled: boolean` is used to prevent installation of the hotkey when set to false (default value: `true`)
* `splitKey: string` is used to change the splitting character inside the keys argument. Default is `+`, but if you want
to listen to the `+` character, you can set `splitKey` to i.e. `-` and listen for `ctrl-+`
* `keyup: boolean` Determine if you want to listen on the keyup event
* `keydown: boolean` Determine if want to listen on the keydown event

## Memoisation

Let's check out a slightly different example to see how memoisation effects your application.

<Playground>
  {() => {
    const [amount, setAmount] = useState(0);
    useHotkeys('n', () => setAmount(amount + 100));
    return (
      <div>
        Add {amount} dollars to my bank account.
      </div>
    );
  }}
</Playground>

You'll notice that it will work on the first key stroke you hit, but after that the value won't change anymore. This is
called stale state. What happened is that we defined a callback that depends on a value which changes over time. In this
case it's the `amount` variable. Our `() => setAmount(amount + 100)` callback gets memoised inside the `useHotkeys` hook
and since we don't define any dependencies our callback will always stay the same and reference the same value it retrieved
the first time it got executed. So inside the `useHotkeys` hook the value of `amount` will always be `0`, which is the
initial value. You can see that for yourself, when copying this example and changing the initial value.
Going a step further in our logic flow, this means that our callback will always call `setAmount` with the value `100`.
So our logic flow got stuck, tis not what we wanted.

To fix this there are two approaches when using values that are retrieved by `useState`. You could define a dependency array as
the third parameter like so:

<Playground>
  {() => {
    const [amount, setAmount] = useState(0);
    // Works but has binding issues
    useHotkeys('m', () => setAmount(amount + 100), {}, [amount]);
    return (
      <div>
        Add {amount} dollars to my bank account.
      </div>
    );
  }}
</Playground>

But if you look closely this will cause problems. `Amount` changes with every call, so our callback will be recreated
every time. Which means that hotkeys will unbind and bind our callback every time we hit the key stroke. This might
seem okay but can cause scoping problems and mess up the internals of our application. Also, the idea behind memoisation
is that we do not execute everything all the time but wait for changes. To fix that we just have to use the callback
approach for `setAmount` like in the very first example:

<Playground>
  {() => {
    const [amount, setAmount] = useState(0);
    useHotkeys('l', () => setAmount(amount => amount + 100));
    return (
      <div>
        Add {amount} dollars to my bank account.
      </div>
    );
  }}
</Playground>

## `contentEditable` prop

As of version 3.3 the `contentEditable` prop does work as intended. The hook will not trigger any hotkeys while the user
edits the field content.

<Playground>
  {() => {
    const [amount, setAmount] = useState(0);
    useHotkeys('f', () => setAmount(prevAmount => prevAmount + 100));
    return (
      <>
        <div>
          {amount >= 0 ? 'Add' : 'Remove'} {Math.abs(amount)} dollars {amount >= 0 ? 'from' : 'to'} my bank account.
        </div>
        <div contentEditable={true} suppressContentEditableWarning={true}>Edit this text.</div>
      </>
    );
  }}
</Playground>

If you want to have hotkeys active while a user edits a tags contents you can pass `true` to the `enableOnContentEditable` option:

<Playground>
  {() => {
    const [amount, setAmount] = useState(0);
    useHotkeys('cmd+s', (e) => {
      e.preventDefault();
      setAmount(prevAmount => prevAmount + 100);
    }, {enableOnContentEditable: true});
    return (
      <>
        <div>
          {amount >= 0 ? 'Add' : 'Remove'} {Math.abs(amount)} dollars {amount >= 0 ? 'from' : 'to'} my bank account.
        </div>
        <div contentEditable={true} suppressContentEditableWarning={true}>Edit this text.</div>
      </>
    );
  }}
</Playground>

## Using arrow keys

To use arrow keys, please use `left`, `right`, `up` and `down` as the identifiers for the arrows, like so:

<Playground>
  {() => {
    const [amount, setAmount] = useState(0);
    useHotkeys('shift-right', () => setAmount(prevAmount => prevAmount + 100), {splitKey: '-'});
    return (
      <>
        <div>
          Add {amount} dollars to my bank account.
        </div>
      </>
    );
  }}
</Playground>
