# useHotkeys

The `useHotkeys` hook follows the hotkeys call signature.

The callback function takes the exact parameters as the callback function in the hotkeys package.
See hotkeys documentation for more info or look into the typings file.

When the component gets mounted into the DOM, it will listen for the keystroke. When the component will unmount, it
stops listening for the keystroke.

```ts
useHotkeys(keys: string, callback: (event: KeyboardEvent, handler: HotkeysEvent) => void, deps: any[] = [])
```

## Parameters
* `keys: string`: Here you can set the key strokes you want the hook to listen to. You can use single or multiple keys,
modifier combination, etc. See [this](https://github.com/jaywcjlove/hotkeys/#defining-shortcuts)
section on the hotkeys documentation for more info.
* `callback: (event: KeyboardEvent, handler: HotkeysEvent) => void`: Gets executed when the defined keystroke
gets hit by the user. **Important:** Since version 1.5.0 this callback gets memoised inside the hook. So you don't have
to do this anymore by yourself.
* `deps: any[] = []`: The dependency array that gets appended to the memoisation of the callback. Here you define the inner
dependencies of your callback. If for example your callback actions depend on a referentially unstable value or a value
that will change over time, you should add this value to your deps array. Since most of the time your callback won't
depend on any unstable callbacks or changing values over time you can leave this value alone since it will be set to an
empty array by default. See the [Memoisation](#memoisation) section to
learn more and see an example where you have to set this array.

## Example

This will listen to the `ctrl+k` keystroke. If you press it, the counter increments by one. If `ctrl+l` gets pressed,
the counter will decrement by one.

### Important changes since 1.5.0!
Due to the nature of how `useEffect` works, to prevent resetting the hotkeys handler during every render, before 1.5.0
you had to memoise your callback yourself. Since this is tedious work and dependency arrays are a common pattern inside
React hooks, I decided to bring the memoisation inside the hook, so you don't have to deal with it. Please read the
**Memoisation** section for more info on this.

```js
import { useHotkeys } from 'react-hotkeys-hook';
```

```jsx
const AddToBankComponent = () => {
  const [amount, setAmount] = useState(0);

  useHotkeys('ctrl+a', () => setAmount(prevAmount => prevAmount + 100));
  useHotkeys('ctrl+d', () => setAmount(prevAmount => prevAmount - 100));

  return (
    <div>
      {amount >= 0 ? 'Add' : 'Remove'} {Math.abs(amount)} dollars {amount >= 0 ? 'from' : 'to'} my bank account.
    </div>
  );
};
```

<Playground>
  {() => {
    const [amount, setAmount] = useState(0);

    useHotkeys('ctrl+a', () => setAmount(prevAmount => prevAmount + 100));
    useHotkeys('ctrl+d', () => setAmount(prevAmount => prevAmount - 100));

    return (
      <div>
        {amount >= 0 ? 'Add' : 'Remove'} {Math.abs(amount)} dollars {amount >= 0 ? 'from' : 'to'} my bank account.
      </div>
    );
  }}
</Playground>

## Memoisation

Let's check out a slightly different example to see how memoisation effects your application.

```jsx
const AddToBankComponent = () => {
  const [amount, setAmount] = useState(0);

  useHotkeys('n', () => setAmount(amount + 100), []);

  return (
    <div>
      Add {Math.abs(amount)} dollars to my bank account.
    </div>
  );
};
```

<Playground>
  {() => {
    const [amount, setAmount] = useState(0);

    useHotkeys('n', () => setAmount(amount + 100), []);

    return (
      <div>
        Add {Math.abs(amount)} dollars to my bank account.
      </div>
    );
  }}
</Playground>

You'll notice that it will work on the first key stroke you hit, but after that the value won't change anymore. This is
called stale state. What happened is that we defined a callback that depends on a value which changes over time. In this
case it's the `amount` variable. Our `() => setAmount(amount + 100)` callback gets memoised inside the `useHotkeys` hook
and since we don't define any dependencies our callback will always stay the same and reference the same value it retrieved
the first time it got executed. So inside the `useHotkeys` hook the value of `amount` will always be `0`, which is the
initial value. You can see that for yourself, when copying this example and changing the initial value.
Going a step further in our logic flow, this means that our callback will always call `setAmount` with the value `100`.
So our logic flow got stuck, tis not what we wanted.

To fix this there are two approaches when using values that are retrieved by `useState`. You could define a dependency array as
the third parameter like so:

```jsx
const AddToBankComponent = () => {
  const [amount, setAmount] = useState(0);

  useHotkeys('m', () => setAmount(amount + 100), [amount]);

  return (
    <div>
      Add {Math.abs(amount)} dollars to my bank account.
    </div>
  );
};
```

<Playground>
  {() => {
    const [amount, setAmount] = useState(0);

    useHotkeys('m', () => setAmount(amount + 100), [amount]);

    return (
      <div>
        Add {Math.abs(amount)} dollars to my bank account.
      </div>
    );
  }}
</Playground>

But if you look closely this will cause problems. `Amount` changes with every call, so our callback will be recreated
every time. Which means that hotkeys will unbind and bind our callback every time we hit the key stroke. This might
seem okay but can cause scoping problems and mess up the internals of our application. Also, the idea behind memoisation
is that we do not execute everything all the time but wait for changes. To fix that we just have to use the callback
approach for `setAmount` like in the very first example:

```jsx
const AddToBankComponent = () => {
  const [amount, setAmount] = useState(0);

  useHotkeys('m', () => setAmount(amount => amount + 100), []);

  return (
    <div>
      Add {Math.abs(amount)} dollars to my bank account.
    </div>
  );
};
```
