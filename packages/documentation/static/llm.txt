# React Hotkeys Hook

> React Hotkeys Hook is a React hook library for handling keyboard shortcuts in a declarative way. It provides a simple API to bind hotkeys to callback functions within your React components.

Important notes:

- This library is designed for React 16.8+ and requires the Hooks API
- It supports both single keys and key combinations (e.g., `ctrl+s`, `shift+alt+a`)
- Hotkeys can be scoped to specific components or made global
- The library is written in TypeScript and provides full type support out of the box
- It uses the browser's native KeyboardEvent API
