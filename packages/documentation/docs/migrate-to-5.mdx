# Migrate from 4.x to 5.x

There are a few breaking changes in 5.x. This guide will help you migrate your code.

## Behavior changes

### `useHotkeys` listens to the code instead of the key by default

From version 5 on `useHotkeys` will listen to the key code instead of the key. This means that if you were using `useHotkeys`
to listen to a key (`:` or `%`, etc.), you'll have to update your code.

The hook now accepts an option called `useKey` that will only listen to the produced key. This is useful if you don't care
about the layout of the keyboard and want to listen to the symbol that the user produces (i.e. listening to `/` to open a search bar).

## API changes

### `HotkeysProvider` Context

#### `enabledScopes` is now `activeScopes`
`enabledScopes` has been renamed to `activeScopes`, to avoid confusion with the `enableScopes` method.


## Other changes

- We dropped the CommonJS Module. The hook is now only available as an ES Module. If you need to use it in a CommonJS environment, you can use a bundler like Webpack or Rollup to convert it to CommonJS.
