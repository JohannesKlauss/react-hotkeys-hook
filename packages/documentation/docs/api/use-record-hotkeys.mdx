# useRecordHotkeys API

Function signature:

```ts
function useRecordHotkeys(useKey?: boolean, blacklist?: string[]): [Set<string>, { start: () => void, stop: () => void, resetKeys: () => void, isRecording: boolean }]
```

## `useKey`

By default recording hotkeys will record the keys code, not the produced
character. If you want to record the produced character, you can pass `true`
as the first argument to the hook.

## `blacklist`

Optional list of key names that should be ignored while recording.
Keys present in this list will retain their default behaviour and will not
be included in the recorded set.

***

## Return value

```ts
const [keys, { start, stop, resetKeys, isRecording }] = useRecordHotkeys()
```
