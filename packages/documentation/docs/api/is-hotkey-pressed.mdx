# isHotkeyPressed API

Function signature:

```ts
function isHotkeyPressed(key: string | string[], splitKey: string = ','): boolean
```

This function allows us to check if a specific key or combination of keys is pressed by the user.

```jsx
const isHotkeyPressed = useIsHotkeyPressed();

const onClick = () => isHotkeyPressed('shift') ? setCount(count - 1) : setCount(count + 1);
```

***

## Arguments

### key

```ts
key: string | string[]
```

The key or keys to check. This can be a single keycode string (like `'a'`), a
delimited string of keycodes (like `'shift,a'`), or an array of keycode strings
(like `['shift','a']`). If multiple keys are provided, either as a delimited
string or as an array, all keys must be pressed down for the function to return
`true`.

Special characters that require `shift` to be held (like `!`, `@`, `#`, `?`,
etc.) are also not directly supported; instead, check if the base key is held
(like `1`, `2`, `3`, `slash`, etc.) along with the `shift` key (e.g.
`['shift','1']`).

:::caution Warning 
The `mod` key is not supported. Please check for `ctrl` and
`meta` keys separately.
:::

### splitKey

```ts
key: string = ','
```

The delimiter used to parse multiple keys from a single string. This is a comma
(`,`) by default.

## Return value

### boolean

The function returns `true` if the key or key combination is currently pressed
down, otherwise it will return `false`.
