# useRecordHotkeys

This hook allows you to record a hotkey stroke by the user. This is useful if you want the user to define their custom
keystroke for your application.

## Basic Usage

Import the `useRecordHotkeys` hook from the package:

```js
import { useRecordHotkeys } from 'react-hotkeys-hook';
```

or if you are using `require` style syntax:

```js
const { useRecordHotkeys } = require('react-hotkeys-hook')
// or
const useRecordHotkeys = require('react-hotkeys-hook').useRecordHotkeys
```

***

### Record hotkeys

In order to record a hotkey, you need to call the `useRecordHotkeys` hook. This hook returns an array similar to the `useState`
hook, but the second argument has some extra properties.

```jsx live
function ExampleComponent() {
  const [keys, { start, stop, isRecording }] = useRecordHotkeys()

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Is recording: {isRecording ? 'yes' : 'no'}</p>
      <p>Recorded keys: {Array.from(keys).join(' + ')}</p>
      <br />
      <button onClick={start}>Record</button>
      <button onClick={stop}>Stop</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

:::info
Note that the returned value of the recorded keys is a `Set` object. This is because every key gets recorded only once.
Implementation wise it is easier to use a `Set` than an array, but you can convert it to an array if you want or need to,
like we are in the example above.
:::

## Ignoring specific keys

You can exclude certain keys from being recorded by passing a `blacklist` array as the second argument. Keys in the blacklist will retain their default behavior and will not be added to the recorded set.

```jsx live
function ExampleWithBlacklist() {
  const [keys, { start, stop, resetKeys, isRecording }] = useRecordHotkeys(false, ['tab', 'enter']);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Recording (ignoring Tab and Enter): {isRecording ? 'yes' : 'no'}</p>
      <p>Recorded keys: {Array.from(keys).join(' + ')}</p>
      <button onClick={start}>Record</button>
      <button onClick={stop}>Stop</button>
      <button onClick={resetKeys}>Reset Keys</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```
