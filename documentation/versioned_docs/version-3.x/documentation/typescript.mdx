# Using TypeScript

:::tip Works out of the box!
React Hotkeys Hook is written in TypeScript and therefore ready to go with our TypeScript project.

:::

## Examples

Using type safety to prevent the passing of parameters with an incorrect type.

```tsx
import { useHotkeys } from "react-hotkeys-hook";
import { useState } from "React";

interface Props {
  hotKey: number;
}

const MyComponent = ({hotKey}: Props) => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  // This will produce an error, because hotKey has to be of type string.
  useHotkeys(hotKey, () => setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1));

  return (
    <div>
      The count is {count}.
    </div>
  )
}
```

***

Using TypeScript to infer the type of the given ref.

```tsx
import { useHotkeys } from "react-hotkeys-hook";
import { useState } from "React";

interface Props {
  hotKey: string;
}

const MyComponent = ({hotKey}: Props) => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  // ref will have the type of React.MutableRef<HTMLDivElement>
  const ref = useHotkeys(hotKey, () => setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1));

  return (
    <div ref={ref}>
      The count is {count}.
    </div>
  )
}
```
