# isHotkeyPressed

This function allows us to check if the user is currently pressing down a key.

## Basic Usage

Import the `isHotkeyPressed` function from the package:

```js
import { isHotkeyPressed } from 'react-hotkeys-hook';
```

or if you are using `require` style syntax:

```js
const { isHotkeyPressed } = require('react-hotkeys-hook')
// or
const isHotkeyPressed = require('react-hotkeys-hook').isHotkeyPressed
```

***

### Check for pressed keys on callbacks

One common use case would be to check if the user

```jsx live
function ExampleComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const onClick = () => isHotkeyPressed('shift') ? setCount(count - 1) : setCount(count + 1);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>The count is: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={onClick}>Alter the count</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Just like with `useHotkeys`, you can pass an array as the first argument to check for multiple keys.
