# useHotkeys

This hook allows us to listen to hotkeys in a declarative way and execute a callback function once the user pressed down
the given hotkey.

:::tip tip
This documentation is using [react-live](https://react-live.netlify.app/), so we can edit the code of every example and
immediately see the results of our changes.
:::

# Basic Usage

Import the `useHotkeys` hook from the package:

```js
import { useHotkeys } from 'react-hotkeys-hook';
```

or when using `require` style syntax:

```js
const { useHotkeys } = require('react-hotkeys-hook')
// or
const useHotkeys = require('react-hotkeys-hook').useHotkeys
```

## Simple Hotkey

The most basic usage for the hook is to assign a hotkey we want to listen to and a callback to get executed once the user
hits that key.

```jsx live
function ExampleComponent() {
  useHotkeys('a', () => alert('Key a was pressed'))

  return (
    <span>Press the a key to see it work.</span>
  )
}
```

> To make the hotkeys work, you have to focus the rendered output of the Live Editor.

***

Inside the callback we can do whatever we like. One common use case is to alter some component state:

```jsx live
function ExampleComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
  useHotkeys('b', () => setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1))

  return (
    <span>Pressed the 'b' key {count} times.</span>
  )
}
```

`useHotkeys` will create the listener on component mount and destroy the listener once the component unmounts.

***

## Multiple hotkeys per component

Since `useHotkeys` is a hook, we can use it in one component as much as we like:

```jsx live
function ExampleComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
  useHotkeys('q', () => setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1))
  useHotkeys('w', () => setCount(prevCount => prevCount - 1))

  return (
    <span>The count is {count}.</span>
  )
}
```

***

## Keystrokes

We can also listen to keystrokes. That is a combination of keys that the user has to hit in order to execute the callback.
One example would be a Jira like UI that listens to the `Shift+C` keystroke to create a new ticket:

```jsx live
function CreateIssue() {
  const [showIssueCreatorModal, setShowIssueCreatorModal] = useState(false)

  useHotkeys('shift+c', () => setShowIssueCreatorModal(true))

  return (
    <>
      {showIssueCreatorModal && <div>MODAL CONTENT</div>}
      {!showIssueCreatorModal && <div>issue list</div>}
    </>
  )
}
```

This is not restricted to a combination of two keys. We can also do things like `Ctrl+Shift+A+C` (maybe not the most
intuitive keystroke for a user to memorize, though).

```jsx live
function ExampleComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
  useHotkeys('ctrl+shift+a+c', () => setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1))

  return (
    <span>Pressed the 'ctrl+shift+a+c' key {count} times.</span>
  )
}
```

:::note the keys argument is case-insensitive
It doesn't matter if we listen for `CTRL+S`, `Ctrl+s`, `ctrl+S` or any other possible way of writing the keys in different
cases. They all will listen to the user pressing the `ctrl` and the `s` key. This also means that upper case letters
are treated as lower case letters. If we want to listen to the user pressing the upper case letter `S`, we'd have to listen
to `shift+s`.
:::

***

## Multiple hotkeys

We can also listen to multiple keystrokes and/or hotkeys and trigger the same callback. Combinations are separated by
a comma sign:

```jsx live
function ExampleComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
  useHotkeys('ctrl+shift+a+c, c, shift+c', () => setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1))

  return (
    <span>Received the combination {count} times.</span>
  )
}
```

You can also use an array as first arguments: `useHotkeys(['ctrl+shift+a+c', 'c', 'shift+c'], ....`

:::info Noticed something?
We used the `ctrl+shift+a+c` and `shift+c` combination two times for two components on this page.
Since we pressed down one hotkey already the example above started at the count of one. Hotkeys are attached
globally if we don't use its return value.

***

## Modifiers & Special keys

Of course, we also want to leverage more complex keystrokes. `useHotkeys` supports the following modifiers:

* `shift`
* `alt`
* `ctrl`
* `meta`

:::info macOS and Windows/Linux compatability
Since version 4 `alt` and `option` are identical. The `meta` key is the same as `cmd` on macOS and `ctrl` on Windows/Linux.
:::

```jsx
function ExampleComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
  useHotkeys(
    'ctrl+shift+a+c, c, shift+c, alt+n, ctrl+d, meta+d',
    () => setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1)
  )

  return (
    <span>Received the combination {count} times.</span>
  )
}
```

***

There are also special keys like arrows, return, space bar, etc. that have their own name that can be used:

* `backspace`
* `tab`
* `clear`
* `enter` or `return`
* `esc` or `escape`
* `space`
* `up`, `down`, `left`, `right`
* `pageup`, `pagedown`
* `del` or `delete`
* `f1`, `f2` ... `f19`

:::caution Warning
Please be aware that there are some hotkeys that we cannot override, because they would interfere with a safe browsing
experience for the user. These depend on the browser.
For example in Chrome, most notably those are `meta + w` which closes a tab, `meta + n` for opening a new window and `meta + t` to open a new tab.
Additionally `meta + shift + w` (closing all tabs of the current window), `meta + shift + n` (opening incognito window) and
`meta + shift + t` (reopen the last closed tab) cannot be overridden.
`meta + up + 1..9` on the other hand focuses the corresponding tab of the active window and also cannot be overridden.
