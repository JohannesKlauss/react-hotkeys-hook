# Setting callback dependencies

The callback we pass to `useHotkeys` gets memoised automatically inside the useHotkeys hook to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
This can lead to
problems with [stale state](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-faq.html#why-am-i-seeing-stale-props-or-state-inside-my-function).
To prevent those problems, the hook accepts a dependencies array, just like Reacts internal
[`useEffect`](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html), [`useMemo`](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usememo) and
[`useCallback`](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usecallback) hooks.

> The general rule is to put every unstable reference used inside the callback into the dependency array.

Let's change the second example up a bit to illustrate the problem of stale state. Just as a reminder, we build a simple counter
component:

```jsx live
function ExampleComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
  const ref = useHotkeys('b', () => setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1))

  return (
    <span ref={ref} tabIndex={-1}>Pressed the 'b' key {count} times.</span>
  )
}
```

:::note Notice
Remember, that we are using the `ref` to scope our hotkey to this specific component. To let the component receive focus
we add the `tabIndex={-1}` prop, since `<span>` tags cannot receive focus by default.

***

Now, what if we change up the callback execution just a bit?

```jsx live
function ExampleComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
  const ref = useHotkeys('b', () => setCount(count + 1))

  return (
    <span ref={ref} tabIndex={-1}>Pressed the 'b' key {count} times.</span>
  )
}
```

While the first component works as expected, the second does not and stops increasing `count` once we pressed the `'b'`
key. This is called stale state. We are referencing a variable that changes over time. Since our callback gets memoised
inside `useHotkeys` hook, the variable `count` inside the callback will always hold the value of `0`.

To solve this problem, we could go back to the previous example. But that solution is specific to the `useState` hook.
What if we want reference
something other than a state variable, like a `useMemo` result? We can use the dependency array for that!

```jsx live
function ExampleComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
  const squaredCount = useMemo(() => count * 2, [count])

  const ref = useHotkeys('b', () => setCount(squaredCount + 1), [squaredCount])

  return (
    <span ref={ref} tabIndex={-1}>Pressed the 'b' key {squaredCount} times.</span>
  )
}
```

If you remove the dependency array from `useHotkeys` you will notice that again the callback execution _seems_ to stop
after the first key press. But as we learned this is all due to stale state. The callback gets executed properly, just
the referenced value is an old one.
