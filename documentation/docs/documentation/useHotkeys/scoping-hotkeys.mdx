# Scoping hotkeys to components

## Global hotkeys and scoped components

In the previous section we used two keystrokes in two different examples (`ctrl+shift+a+c` and `shift+c`).
If we press down one of the keystroke it will trigger both components. Why is that?
Hotkeys are attached globally, so there is no default scoping mechanism for them to only trigger if the component is
focused. To emphasize the issue, check out these two components:

```jsx live noInline
function UnscopedHotkey() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
  useHotkeys('c', () => setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1))

  return (
    <p>The count is {count}.</p>
  )
}

function SecondUnscopedHotkey() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
  useHotkeys('c', () => setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1))

  return (
    <p>The count is {count}.</p>
  )
}

render(
  <div>
    <UnscopedHotkey/>
    <SecondUnscopedHotkey/>
  </div>
)
```

Everytime we press down the `c` key, both component trigger the callback. But how can we separate those two components
and their assigned hotkeys? The answer is [`Refs`](https://reactjs.org/docs/refs-and-the-dom.html). `useHotkeys` returns
a mutable React reference that we can attach to any component that takes a ref. This way we
can tell the hook which element should receive the users focus before it triggers the callback.

```jsx live noInline
function ScopedHotkey() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
  const ref = useHotkeys('shift+a', () => setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1))

  return (
    <>
      <p>The count is {count}. Click anywhere expect for the button to disable the hotkey.</p>
      <button ref={ref}>
        Click me to enable the hotkey
      </button>
    </>
  )
}

function SecondScopedHotkey() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
  const ref = useHotkeys('shift+a', () => setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1))

  return (
    <>
      <p>The count is {count}. Click anywhere expect for the button to disable the hotkey.</p>
      <button ref={ref}>
        Click me to enable the hotkey
      </button>
    </>
  )
}

render(
  <div>
    <ScopedHotkey/>
    <hr/>
    <SecondScopedHotkey/>
  </div>
)
```

As you can see only if the button receives focus the hotkey is enabled. We also added second component that
listens to the same hotkey but only triggers if an assigned component receives focus.

We successfully scoped our duplicate global hotkeys to their own components. This practise isn't restricted to duplicate
hotkeys, we can use this technique to scope any hotkey we like.

## Scoping with non-focus components

Receiving focus on a button to enable a hotkey in a real world application is not very useful. Instead, we generally would
programmatically set the focus to a modal or let the user click on an area which then receives the focus and enables
its attached hotkeys. However, tags like `<div>`, `<section>`, `<span>`, etc. cannot receive focus by default. To let them
receive focus we have to use the `tabIndex` prop:

```jsx live
function SecondScopedHotkey() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
  const ref = useHotkeys('shift+a', () => setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1))

  return (
    <div ref={ref} tabIndex={-1} style={{border: '2px solid #9e768f'}}>
      <p>The count is {count}. Click inside this area to enable the hotkey.</p>
    </div>
  )
}
```

:::info Important
To ensure that you don't accidentally break sequential keyboard navigation of your page elements, we recommend to always
set the `tabIndex` prop to `-1`. This way the element is not reachable via keyboard navigation. For more information on
this topic, check out the [MDN page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/tabindex).

## Nesting scoped hotkeys

This of course also works with nesting components:

```jsx live noInline
function NestedScopedHotkey() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
  const ref = useHotkeys('shift+a', () => setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1))

  return (
    <div ref={ref} tabIndex={-1} style={{border: '2px solid deeppink'}}>
      <p>The count is {count}. Click inside this area to enable the hotkey.</p>
    </div>
  )
}

function ScopedHotkey({children}) {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
  const ref = useHotkeys('shift+a', () => setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1))

  return (
    <div ref={ref} tabIndex={-1} style={{border: '2px solid #9e768f', padding: '3px'}}>
      <p>The count is {count}. Click inside this area to enable the hotkey.</p>
      {children}
    </div>
  )
}

render(
  <ScopedHotkey>
    <NestedScopedHotkey/>
  </ScopedHotkey>
)
```
