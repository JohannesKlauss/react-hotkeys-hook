## Using typescript types to reference key names
Sometimes we might get confused if we need to listen to `ArrowLeft` or `LeftArrow` to listen to the left arrow key.
To avoid this confusion, we can use the typescript types provided by the `ts-key-now` library.

You add the library to your project by running:

```bash
npm install ts-key-now
```

Then you can import the types and use them in your code:

```ts
import { Key } from 'ts-key-enum'

useHotkeys(Key.Backspace, () => {
  console.log(`delete`)
})
```

See https://gitlab.com/nfriend/ts-key-enum/-/blob/master/Key.enum.d.ts for the full list of available keys.
