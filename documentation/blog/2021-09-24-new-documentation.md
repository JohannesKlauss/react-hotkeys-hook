## New Docs

The last couple of weeks I overhauled the documentation to better explain how the hook works and what you can do with it.
I hope this will reduce questions that are frequently popping up in the issues panel of the
[Github repo](https://github.com/JohannesKlauss/react-hotkeys-hook).
The new site is powered by [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), an awesome tool to quickly set up a complete documentation ecosystem.
Be sure to check that out if you yourself have to write a documentation.

This includes a [Quick Start section](/docs/intro), extensive documentation about [every parameter the hook accepts](/docs/api/use-hotkeys)
with a lot of examples to cover different scenarios,
different approaches, pitfalls and shortcomings.

The recipes section will get content later on. I might also add a comparison page to other hotkey packages for react,
probably the most interesting would be a comparison to [react-hotkeys](https://github.com/greena13/react-hotkeys).

If you find any typos, confusing sentences, have questions or think that some points need to be elaborated on, please let
me know by [opening an issue](https://github.com/JohannesKlauss/react-hotkeys-hook/issues/new).

There is no search functionality yet. I hope to add that soon.

I will now start the work on version 4, which everyone is welcome to contribute to. There is an
[open issue](https://github.com/JohannesKlauss/react-hotkeys-hook/issues/574) titled "Roadmap to Version 4" where you can
join our discussion about what version 4 should look like and add feature wise.

## New Support Channel

Since there are popping up question on all different kind of channels (Github issues, email, private messages, etc.)
on how to use react-hotkeys-hook I added a [discussions](https://github.com/JohannesKlauss/react-hotkeys-hook/discussions)
panel on the Github Repo. If you have questions please use this section to ask them, and I am happy to help you out.
Make sure to use the Q&A category.
Of course you can also ask your questions on [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/search?page=1&tab=Relevance&q=react-hotkeys-hook).

Last but not least: thank you all for the ongoing interest in this package.

## In need for a logo/icon

I'd love to have an icon for this package, but I have zero talent for graphic design. If anybody would like to contribute
a small and simple logo for this package, I'd more than welcome it.
